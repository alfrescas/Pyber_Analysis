# Pyber Analysis:

## Project Overview
The company Pyber, seeks a data analysis that would assess and showcase ride-sharing services results to neighborhoods that are underserved. The results of the analysis will improve affordibility and accessibility to these neighborhoods. The company's CEO V. Isualize has asked for the following:
 - A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
 - Creating a multiple line graph that shows the fares for each city type.
 - A summary of the data analysis that will be used by decision-makers at Pyber.

## Resources used for analysis:
 -Data Sources: PyBer_ride_data.csv, city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
 
 ## Pyber Analysis Results:
 
 Utilizing the data sources provided for the analysis, I was able to merge the data using the pd.merge method as shown below:

 After doing calculations to create a summary DataFrame for the ride-sharing data, below is the image of the results:

 Subsequently, I  reset the data to start calcultaions on the time, dates, and fares for each city types. In doing so, I was able to modify the data to get the calculations needed to create the DataFrame chart that would be used to obtain line graph. The results are below:

 The results show that the _Rural_ city type is the most underserved, the city type is _Suburban_, and the city type with the most ride-sharing success is _Urban_. 

# Summary:

Based on the analysis provided, in order for Pyber to achieve it's goal in creating ride-sharing accessibility to underserved neighborhoods
